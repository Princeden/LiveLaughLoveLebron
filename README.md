## Description:
As avid enthusiasts of both poker and (responsible) gambling, we have decided to create a poker website. Players should be able to have an account that will allow them to play games of poker, track a money balance, and their poker stats. Players will begin with a set balance. If a player completely runs out of money, they can no longer play any games.Multiple players will be able to play on the same local machine by requiring an account specific password to see their cards. Turns rotate, with only one player being in control at any given time.

The game of choice will be Texas hold 'em, a popular modern variation of poker. Each player is dealt two cards, and over time 5 cards will appear on the table. Once all 5 cards are on the table, and if the remaining players reveal the cards, the winner is the player who can make the best five-card hand out of their seven total cards. (Five shared between all players, two private to each player.)

### Recommended Method: 
We recommend to do this procedure using the Git Clone method. Click the green button in the top right that says "Code". Then, choose "SSH" in the dropdown that appears and copy the URL that is given. Finally, open up your terminal, cd into wherever you desire to hold the folder. Then, type 
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Princeden/LiveLaughLoveLebron.git
```

### Alternate Method: 
This is an alternate method, if you don't prefer the Git Clone method. Go to the green button in the top right again that says "Code". Then, click "Download Zip". Finally, extract the ZIP file from your downloads and place it in your desired directory. 

Reagardless of which method you choose, navigate to the repo folder and type ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install required dependencies
